# Marco, Polo!
## Brief
Simple bash script that lets you mark a working directory, traverse anywhere else during the same shell session, and then jump back to the marked directory with a single command.

## How to Use
- In the directory you want to mark, execute:
  ```bash
  marco
  ```
- At any other time, while in the same shell session, return to the marked directory via:
  ```bash
  polo
  ```
